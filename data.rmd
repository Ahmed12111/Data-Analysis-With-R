<h1 style="text-align: center;color:#19a3e7">Comprehensive Analysis of Hotel Booking Trends</h1>

---

<h2 style='color: #19a3e7'> Introduction </h2>

In today's fast-paced travel industry, hotel bookings are influenced by numerous factors such as seasonality, customer preferences, and global events. For instance, imagine a small but popular hotel chain, Sunset Getaways, located in Europe. This hotel saw a sharp increase in bookings in the summer months, primarily driven by vacationers seeking coastal escapes. However, challenges arose as the hotel faced a series of cancellations during the off-peak seasons due to unforeseen events like travel restrictions or changing weather patterns.

To better understand these fluctuations and improve business strategies, Sunset Getaways decided to analyze its hotel booking data. By exploring booking patterns, customer preferences, and seasonal trends, the hotel aimed to optimize its marketing campaigns, improve room allocation, and ensure higher customer satisfaction.

This report delves into the hotel booking dataset, analyzing the trends and insights that can help hoteliers like Sunset Getaways make informed decisions, address operational challenges, and anticipate customer needs.

<h2 style='color: #19a3e7'> Methodology </h2>

The analysis was conducted on a hotel booking dataset to explore key trends, patterns, and insights regarding customer behavior, pricing strategies, and operational performance. The following steps outline the methodology used for this analysis:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**  
   The dataset was first cleaned to remove any inconsistencies or missing values. Null values in important columns were handled using appropriate strategies such as imputation or removal based on the significance of the missing data. For instance, columns like `reservation_status`, `adr` (Average Daily Rate), and `arrival_date` were critical for analysis, and thus missing values were either replaced or carefully handled.  
  
   The `arrival_date_month` and `arrival_date_year` were converted into appropriate factor levels to ensure proper sorting and analysis for time-based trends.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Initial exploratory analysis was performed to understand the overall structure of the data and The EDA focused on:

   - **Monthly and Yearly Trends**: The distribution of bookings across different months and years was analyzed using bar charts and line graphs to identify peak booking periods and seasonal variations.
  
   - **Customer Type and ADR Analysis**: A detailed analysis of the `customer_type` and its relationship with the `adr` (Average Daily Rate) was performed to understand how different customer segments contributed to revenue.

   - **Country-wise ADR Analysis**: Countries were ranked based on their ADR values, and the top 10 countries were visualized using a treemap to highlight the countries generating the highest revenue.
  
   - **Reservation Status and Cancellations**: Reservation statuses were explored across different months and hotel types to examine patterns in confirmed, canceled, and no-show bookings. Additionally, the cancellation rate was calculated for different market segments to identify trends.

3. **Visualization Techniques**  
   Multiple types of visualizations were used to communicate insights effectively:
  
   - **Bar Charts**: Used to visualize monthly booking trends, reservation statuses by hotel type, and cancellation rates by market segment. Labels were added for better interpretability.

   - **Line Graphs with Smoothing**: Line graphs with a smoothing function (using `geom_smooth()`) were used to show the ADR trend over time, providing a clear indication of fluctuations and trends in pricing.

   - **Treemap**: To visualize the top 10 countries by ADR, a treemap was chosen to illustrate the relative contribution of each country to the total revenue.
  
   - **Pie Charts**: Pie charts were used to represent the proportion of reservation statuses, giving a clear breakdown of confirmed, canceled, and no-show reservations.

4. **Statistical Analysis**  
   Key statistical measures such as the mean, median, and standard deviation of ADR were calculated for various customer segments and countries. These measures provided insight into the distribution of revenue across different segments and helped identify outliers or significant trends.

5. **Segmentation and Grouping**
   - **Customer Type**: Grouping customers based on type (e.g., transient, group, contract) to examine differences in behavior and revenue contribution.
  
   - **Market Segment**: Analyzing how bookings from different market segments (e.g., corporate, direct, online travel agencies) performed in terms of cancellations and ADR.
  
   - **Reservation Status**: Grouping reservations by status (confirmed, canceled, no-show) to understand operational challenges.

6. **Interpretation of Visualizations**
   - Seasonal peaks in bookings and how these impact revenue.

   - The performance of different market segments in terms of cancellations and revenue.

   - How customer type and country of origin influence the ADR.

   - How cancellation trends vary across market segments and months.

7. **Software and Tools Used**
   The analysis was performed using R and the following libraries:

   - **ggplot2**: For creating visualizations including bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts.

   - **dplyr**: For data manipulation and summarization.

   - **treemap**: To create a treemap for country-wise ADR analysis.
  
   - **scales**: For formatting percentages and currency values in the charts.

<h2 style='color: #19a3e7'> Key Objectives</h2>

- **Analyze Booking Trends**
Explore how hotel bookings vary over time, focusing on monthly and yearly trends. Identify peak booking periods to inform marketing and resource allocation strategies.

- **Examine Cancellation Rates**
Investigate the cancellation rates among different customer segments (e.g., market segment, lead time). Analyze factors contributing to higher cancellation rates and recommend ways to mitigate them.

- **Understand Customer Demographics and Preferences**
Segment customers by demographic factors (e.g., country, customer type) to identify key markets and tailor offerings. Also, analyze whether customers receive their preferred room type and how this impacts satisfaction.

- **Assess Revenue and Pricing Strategies**
Analyze the average daily rate (ADR) across customer types, countries, and market segments to identify which segments are most profitable. Suggest strategies for optimizing pricing to maximize revenue.

#### 1. Monthly Booking Trends by Years

Insight: While the general seasonal trend persists across years, the overall volume of bookings has varied slightly from year to year. Some years might have experienced higher demand during peak months compared to others. This could be due to external factors such as economic conditions, special events, or promotions affecting customer behavior.

![Alt text](img2.png)

### Chart 1 Code

```r
## = Monthly Booking Trends by Years = ##
df$arrival_date_year <- as.factor(df$arrival_date_year)

ggplot(df, aes(x = arrival_date_month, group = arrival_date_year, color = arrival_date_year, linetype = arrival_date_year)) +
  geom_line(stat = 'count', size = 1.2) +
  geom_point(stat = 'count', size = 3) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Monthly Booking Trends by Years", 
       x = "Month", 
       y = "Number of Bookings", 
       color = "Year", 
       linetype = "Year") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = "bold"),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  scale_linetype_manual(values = c("solid", "dashed", "dotted"))
```

#### 2. Monthly Booking Trends Over the Years

Insight: Bookings show a seasonal trend, with peaks in certain months like July and August. This suggests that these are the busiest months for hotel bookings, possibly coinciding with holidays or vacation seasons. On the other hand, months like January and November tend to have fewer bookings, indicating low-demand periods.

        title = "The Top Ten Of Countries By adr",
        fontsize.labels = 12,
        fontsize.title = 14,
        fontcolor.labels = "white",
        border.col = "white",
        title.legend = "Average ADR",
        draw.labels = TRUE,
#        label.format = list(size = 12, format = function(x) sprintf("%.2f", x))
)
```

#### 5. ADR Trend Over Months

Insight: The Average Daily Rate (ADR) shows a clear seasonal trend, peaking during the summer months (June to August), while rates tend to dip during the winter months. The smooth line (LOESS curve) highlights that the ADR consistently follows a predictable seasonal cycle, which could help in pricing strategies for future bookings.

        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = month.name)
```

#### 6. Reservation Status by Month

Insight: The distribution of reservation statuses (e.g., confirmed, canceled) varies by month. There may be a higher number of confirmed reservations during peak months, while cancellation rates could rise during off-season months when customers may reconsider or cancel their travel plans.

![Alt text](img6.png)

### Chart 6 Code

```r
## = Reservation status per month = ##
reservation_status_count <- df %>%
  group_by(reservation_status) %>%
  summarize(count = n())

df_filtered <- df %>% 
  filter(reservation_status %in% c("Check-Out", "Canceled"))

ggplot(df_filtered, aes(x = arrival_date_month, fill = reservation_status)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge", color = "black") +
  geom_text(stat = "count", aes(label = ..count..), 
            position = position_dodge(width = 0.9), vjust = -0.3, size = 3) +

  scale_x_discrete(limits = month.name) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Check-Out" = "#19a3e7", "Canceled" = "#db2763"))
```

#### 7. Reservation Statuses

Insight: The pie chart reveals the proportion of each reservation status, indicating whether most reservations are confirmed, canceled, or otherwise modified. If a large proportion of bookings are canceled, this could signal the need to review the cancellation policies or customer communication strategies.

![Alt text](img7.png)

### Chart 7 Code

```r
## = Proportion of Reservation Statuses = ##
reservation_status_count <- df %>%
  group_by(reservation_status) %>%
  filter(reservation_status %in% c("Check-Out", "Canceled")) %>%
  summarize(count = n())

ggplot(reservation_status_count, aes(x = "", y = count, fill = reservation_status)) +

  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Check-Out" = "#19a3e7", "Canceled" = "#db2763"))
```

#### 8. Reservation Status by Hotel Type

Insight: The reservation status differs between hotel types. For example, city hotels may have higher cancellations compared to resort hotels, which could suggest that city bookings are more short-term or subject to last-minute changes, while resort bookings may be planned well in advance and are more stable.

![Alt text](img8.png)

### Chart 8 Code

```r
## = Reservation Status By Hotel Type = ##

  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Check-Out" = "#19a3e7", "Canceled" = "#db2763"))
```

#### 9. Special Requests by Reservation Status

Insight: This chart shows the total number of special requests associated with "Check-Out" and "Canceled" reservations. If "Canceled" reservations have significantly more special requests, it may indicate that guests with more specific needs are more likely to cancel their reservations.

![Alt text](img9.png)

### Chart 9 Code

```r
## = Special Requests by Reservation Status = ##
df_filtered <- df %>% 
  filter(reservation_status %in% c("Check-Out", "Canceled"))

ggplot(df_filtered, aes(x = reservation_status, y = total_of_special_requests, fill = reservation_status)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun = "sum") +
  geom_text(stat = "summary", fun = "sum", aes(label = ..y..), vjust = -0.5, size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Total Special Requests by Reservation Status", x = "Reservation Status", y = "Total Special Requests") +

  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = "bold"))
```

#### 10. Reservation Status by Meal Type

Insight: This chart compares the number of reservations with different meal plans ("BB" for Bed and Breakfast, "FB" for Full Board, "HB" for Half Board, and "SC" for Self-Catering) between "Check-Out" and "Canceled" statuses. If a particular meal type is more common among canceled reservations, it could suggest a link between meal preferences and reservation stability.

![Alt text](img10.png)

### Chart 10 Code

```r

## = Reservation Status by Meal Type = ##
df_filtered <- df %>% 
  filter(reservation_status %in% c("Check-Out", "Canceled")) %>%
  filter(meal %in% c("BB", "FB", "HB", "SC"))

ggplot(df_filtered, aes(x = reservation_status, fill = meal)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Reservation Status by Meal Type", x = "Reservation Status", y = "Count", fill = "Meal Type") +
  theme_minimal() +

### Chart 14 Code

```r
## = Lead Time Distribution by Hotel Type = ##
ggplot(df, aes(x = hotel, y = lead_time, fill = hotel)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Lead Time Distribution by Hotel Type", x = "Hotel Type", y = "Lead Time (Days)") +
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = "bold"))
```

#### 15. Cancellation Rate by Deposit Type

Insight: This chart shows the proportion of cancellations relative to deposit types. If a higher cancellation rate is associated with a particular deposit type, it may suggest that guests are more likely to cancel if they have made a specific type of deposit. This insight can guide deposit policies to minimize cancellations.

![Alt text](img14.png)

### Chart 15 Code

```r
## = Cancellation Rate by Deposit Type = ##
ggplot(df, aes(x = deposit_type, fill = factor(is_canceled))) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  geom_text(stat = "count", aes(label = scales::percent(..count../sum(..count..))), position = position_fill(vjust = 0.5), size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Cancellation Rate by Deposit Type", x = "Deposit Type", y = "Proportion of Cancellations") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#ff5a5f", "#0077b6"), labels = c("Not Canceled", "Canceled")) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = "bold"))
```

#### 16. Cancellation Rate by Market Segment

Insight: The cancellation rate varies significantly by market segment. Segments such as online travel agencies (OTAs) might have a higher cancellation rate compared to other segments like corporate bookings. This indicates that OTA bookings may be more volatile, possibly due to more flexible cancellation policies offered by these platforms.

### Chart 16 Code

```r
## =cancellation rate by market segment = ##
cancellation_rate <- df %>%
  group_by(market_segment) %>%
  summarize(cancellation_rate = mean(is_canceled))

ggplot(cancellation_rate, aes(x = reorder(market_segment, -cancellation_rate), y = cancellation_rate)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#0077b6", color = "black") +
  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(cancellation_rate)), vjust = -0.3, size = 4) +
  labs(title = "Cancellation Rate by Market Segment", x = "Market Segment", y = "Cancellation Rate") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 14)) +

<h2 style='color: #19a3e7'> Insights and Strategic Suggestions </h2>

### Booking Patterns

- **Insight**: The monthly booking trends indicate seasonal fluctuations in bookings.

- **Recommendation**: Implement promotional offers or discounts during months with lower booking volumes to increase occupancy rates. Additionally, introduce special packages for off-peak seasons to maintain consistent booking levels.

### Cancellation Mitigation

- **Insight**: Certain market segments have higher cancellation rates, particularly as shown in the Cancellation Rate by Market Segment chart.

- **Recommendation**: Reevaluate the cancellation policies for market segments with higher cancellation rates. Consider requiring deposits or offering incentives for confirmed bookings to reduce last-minute cancellations. Enhanced customer engagement could also help lower the cancellation rate.

### Customer Targeting

- **Insight**: The Average Daily Rate by Customer Type chart highlights which customer types generate the highest ADR.

- **Recommendation**: Design targeted marketing campaigns to attract more customers from high-ADR segments. Consider offering loyalty programs or tailored experiences for repeat customers from these segments to further boost revenue.

### Reservation Process Optimization

- **Insight**: The Reservation Status by Month and Reservation Status by Hotel Type charts reveal variations in booking status, including cancellations and check-ins.

- **Recommendation**: Streamline the reservation process by integrating automated systems that reduce room assignment errors. This could also help address the gap between booked and actual reservations, improving customer satisfaction.

### Parking Space Management

- **Insight**: Analysis of special requests, such as for parking spaces, suggests that certain requests are more common in specific periods.

- **Recommendation**: Better allocate parking resources based on high-demand periods. This could involve reserving parking spots in advance or adjusting parking fees during high-occupancy months to optimize space utilization.
